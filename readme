Been studying AI and machine learning for almost half a year now and am beginning to see plateu around learning pipelines and automations. So i decided
to just jump head into projects and try to learn as much as i can.

nobody is probably even going to read this lmao but i might be famous one dayðŸ˜Ž

Anywhos. This project is from a code along

im not that smart, YET.

Some insights gained:
- learning how EDA is done. How to use charts and plots to visualise my data so i can understand it.
- Data cleaning is not as tedious as in practice...
- take note of time series data and not to use cross validation as it can use future data to predict past values and thats a nono
- bad practice to force commit but i was lazy to pull and then recommit.
